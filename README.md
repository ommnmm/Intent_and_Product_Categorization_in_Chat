# Intent and Product Categorization in Customer Chat
This is an NLP case study proposal. It proposes a complete set of methodologies to classify customer intent and extract product information in customer chat data. It proposes a full data pipeline, including text-preprocessing and labeling. It proposes active learning to make the labeling process for POS tags more efficient. The models classify customers' intent into two broad categories first: casual intent (eg. greeting, etc.) and business intent (eg. intent to purchase, etc.). For the business intent part of the messages, the model uses a combination of sequence modeling and a specialized inquiry-response queue to achieve sorting multiple products in a single message. Sequence models include hidden Markov and conditional random field. Conditional random field is evaluated as more suitable for the case. The inquiry-response queue can achieve a decent prototype model for product classification in chat, where a single message can contain multiple product.
